# Lecture 2023-11-22 on shell code

## Overview

This is a summay of the main topics discussed in the lectures:

- Challenges in Writing Shellcode: Focus on the importance of stealth and efficiency in shellcode design. Highlight common security measures that shellcode must bypass.

- 32-bit vs. 64-bit Shellcode: Compare instruction sets, memory addressing, and system call conventions in 32-bit and 64-bit environments.

- Using C and Assembly Language: Emphasize the use of C for structure and Assembly for direct system interaction, providing examples of where each is most effective.

- The execve Function: Explain its role in executing commands from shellcode, and its syntax and parameters.

- Avoiding Zeros in Shellcode: Discuss techniques like XOR encoding to eliminate null bytes, which can disrupt shellcode execution.

- Data Preparation for Shellcode: Address the importance of correctly formatting and aligning data for successful shellcode execution.

- Reverse Shells Concepts: Introduce the concept of reverse shells, their use in cyber attacks, and the basic mechanics behind them.

- File Descriptor Handling: Explain the significance of file descriptors in managing input and output streams in a shellcode context.

- Standard Input/Output Redirection: Cover methods of redirecting IO to control shellcode interaction with the host system.

- Executing Reverse Shells via Code Injection: Discuss the process and security implications of injecting reverse shellcode into vulnerable systems.

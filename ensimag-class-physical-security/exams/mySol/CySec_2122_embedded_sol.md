# CySec Exam 2021/2022 - Embedded systems

## Q1 Why is security in embedded system important? Cite a few domains where embedded systems should be secured, and cite at least an example of an embedded system that was compromised.

Security in embedded systems is critical for several reasons:

1. **Ubiquity**: Embedded systems are everywhere, in a wide range of applications from consumer electronics to critical infrastructure. Their widespread use makes them a prevalent target for attacks.

2. **Access to Sensitive Data**: Many embedded systems process or store sensitive information, such as personal data, financial information, or trade secrets. Unauthorized access to this data can have serious privacy and financial implications.

3. **Control over Physical Systems**: Embedded systems often have direct control over physical processes in industries like manufacturing, automotive, or healthcare. Compromising these systems can lead to physical damage, endangering human lives and causing significant economic loss.

4. **Limited Resources for Security**: Embedded systems usually have constraints in terms of processing power, memory, and energy. This makes implementing robust security measures a challenge, often leading to vulnerabilities.

5. **Long Lifecycle and Lack of Updates**: Many embedded systems are designed to last for years or even decades, with limited scope for updates or patches. This makes them vulnerable to evolving threats over time.

**Domains Where Security of Embedded Systems is Crucial:**

1. **Automotive Industry**: Modern vehicles, including connected and autonomous cars, rely heavily on embedded systems for functions ranging from engine control to safety features and infotainment systems.

2. **Healthcare**: Medical devices such as pacemakers, insulin pumps, and hospital monitoring equipment are embedded systems whose compromise can have direct life-threatening consequences.

3. **Industrial Control Systems**: These systems manage critical infrastructure in sectors like power generation, water treatment, and manufacturing. Compromises in these systems can lead to massive disruptions and environmental damage.

4. **Consumer Electronics**: Smart home devices, smartphones, and other personal gadgets contain embedded systems that manage personal data, making them targets for data theft and privacy breaches.

5. **Telecommunications**: Network equipment like routers and switches are embedded systems that, if compromised, can disrupt communication services and lead to data breaches.

**Example of a Compromised Embedded System:**

- **Stuxnet Worm Attack on Industrial Control Systems**: One of the most famous examples of an embedded system compromise is the Stuxnet worm, which targeted programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used in Iran's nuclear facilities. The malware subtly altered the speeds of centrifuges, causing physical damage while showing normal operating parameters to monitoring systems. This attack underscored the potential for cyber-attacks to cause physical damage to critical infrastructure and highlighted the importance of securing embedded systems against sophisticated threats.

## What is a smartcard? (Technically speaking)

It is a combination of the following:
- CPU: Typically a 8-32 bit processor with low frequency and ARM instruction set. The design is generally proprietary
- Memories: Usually coposed by ROM + RAM + Flash
- True Random Number Generator
- Cryptographic units: to compute DES, AES or to accellerate any cryptographic operation
- Communication interface: serail bi-direction I/O lines
